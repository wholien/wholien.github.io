      <description>As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, working from home (“WFH”) has become one of the most talked about changes for those of us who can do it. WFH is not a fundamentally new concept. But before March 2020, it was seen as a perk, something weird Silicon Valley companies let their employees do every once in a while.
Now, it’s become a necessity. Everyone that isn’t an essential worker is working from home.</description>

      <description>For around two and a half years, I had been working in a Python 2.x environment at my old job . Since switching companies, Ruby and Rails has replaced Python and Flask. At first glance, the languages don&amp;rsquo;t seem super different, but there are definitely common Ruby idioms that I needed to learn.
While adding a new feature, I came across code that looked like this:
if (variable = some_func()) do_something(variable) end Intuitively, I guessed this meant &amp;ldquo;if some_func() returns something, do_something with it.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, this is my personal website.
This will hopefully become the center of my internet presence. I will be writing about things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, which could be as simple as summaries, to more complex and &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; things like my thoughts and reflections.
There will hopefully be a bookshelf / book summaries section, where I summarize and review books.
I will probably write about coding related stuff as well, but I&amp;rsquo;m not yet sure if it should have its own section.</description>
